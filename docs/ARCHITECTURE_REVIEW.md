# Architecture Review — color-convert-rs

> [!abstract] Scope
> Post-MVP self-improvement review — survey the architecture, propose multiple performance
> improvements, drive each through [[concepts/red-green-blue-tdd|RED→GREEN→BLUE TDD]], benchmark,
> and keep only what beats **both** the JS baseline and the previous Rust iteration. Reviewed at
> commit `922b25b` (staging); the self-improvement drive is **concluding after wave 5**.

This is the standalone review artifact backing the self-improvement waves. The concrete outcomes
are tracked in GitHub issues `#24`, `#25`, `#58`, `#61`, `#64`, `#65`, `#71`, `#72`, `#78`, `#79`,
`#86`, `#87` and recorded in [[benchmarks/results-ledger|`benchmarks/results.jsonl`]]; the rollup
lives in [[benchmarks/README|the benchmark rollup]].

## 1. Architecture as surveyed

The crate is a behavior-faithful Rust port of npm `color-convert`, with two acceleration tiers
behind a runtime capability probe.

### 1.1 Layers

| Layer | Files | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Scalar routes** | `rgb.rs`, `hsl.rs`, `hsv.rs`, `hwb.rs`, `cmyk.rs`, `xyz.rs`, `lab.rs`, `lch.rs`, `oklab.rs`, `oklch.rs`, `hcg.rs`, `apple.rs`, `gray.rs`, `hex.rs`, `ansi16.rs`, `ansi256.rs`, `keyword.rs`, `color_name.rs` | Per-pixel `[f64;3]`-array faithful JS ports. One module per source color model. |
| **Routing** | `convert.rs` | Public `convert(from, to, input)` API over a BFS route graph (`Graph` with 50 edges), memoized `path_cache`, held in a `thread_local` singleton. `Model` enum = the 17 color models. |
| **CPU-SIMD** | `simd.rs`, `simd_hsl.rs`, `simd_hsv.rs`, `simd_hwb.rs`, `simd_cmyk.rs`, `simd_hcg.rs`, `simd_oklab.rs`, `simd_apple.rs` | `wide::f32x8` batch paths for the hot matrix-heavy and branchy routes. |
| **GPU** | `gpu.rs` | CubeCL/wgpu batch compute kernel for rgb→lab; per-phase timing (upload/compute/readback). |
| **Probe** | `probe.rs` | Runtime `Backend::{Gpu, CpuSimd}` selection via wgpu adapter enumeration, guarded by `catch_unwind` so a GPU-less host never panics (Rule 5). |
| **Errors** | `error.rs` | `thiserror` enum; library code returns `Result<_, E>`, no `unwrap`/`expect` in library paths. |
| **Benchmark** | `bin/bench.rs`, `bin/bench_simd.rs`, `bin/bench_gpu.rs` | 3-tier harness (JS / CPU-SIMD / GPU) writing the append-only ledger. |

### 1.2 Hot path (the optimization surface)

The performance-critical routes are matrix + transcendental heavy and embarrassingly parallel
per pixel:

- **rgb→xyz**: sRGB inverse-gamma (`powf(2.4)` piecewise) → 3×3 matrix.
- **xyz→lab**: normalize → LAB transfer (`cbrt` piecewise) → scale.
- **rgb→lab**: the composition of the two (the headline route).
- **rgb→hsl** and the **rgb→hsl→rgb** round-trip: min/max/delta + a branchy hue selection.

These are exactly where SIMD and GPU pay off, and where the improvement candidates were aimed. See
[[concepts/cpu-simd-hot-path]] for the full analysis.

### 1.3 Observations feeding the candidate list

1. The SIMD hot loops applied the piecewise **transfer functions scalar lane-by-lane**
   (`to_array()` → 8 scalar `powf`/`cbrt` calls → `f32x8::new()`), de-vectorizing the most
   expensive step. → candidate `#65`.
2. **rgb→hsl** was the heaviest per-pixel scalar route with **no SIMD path**. → candidate `#58`.
3. The **rgb→hsl→rgb** round-trip had a JS baseline but no SIMD path (no vectorized `hsl→rgb`).
   → candidate `#64`.
4. `rgb→lab` materialized an **intermediate `xyz` buffer** between the two SIMD steps. → `#61`.
5. Data-layout question: would **SoA** beat the interleaved **AoS** gather for the SIMD hot
   routes? → candidate `#25`.
6. Open question on the GPU: is the kernel **compute-bound** (so workgroup tuning helps)? → `#24`.

## 2. Proposed improvements & outcomes

Each was driven through the full [[concepts/red-green-blue-tdd|RED→GREEN→BLUE]] cycle in its own
worktree, benchmarked at N=50M on the reference host (NVIDIA RTX 2000 Ada laptop, NixOS), and kept
**only if it beat BOTH** the JS baseline AND the previous Rust iteration (the
[[concepts/keep-or-revert-rule|keep-or-revert rule]]).

| # | Improvement | Target route | Before → After @50M | Δ | Decision |
|---|-------------|--------------|---------------------|---|----------|

| `#61` | Fuse `rgb→xyz→lab` single pass (drop intermediate xyz buffer) | rgb→lab | 21.7 → **24.1** MP/s | **+10.9%** | ✅ kept |
| `#65` | Vectorize srgb/LAB piecewise transfer across f32x8 (SIMD `powf`/`cbrt` + mask-blend) | rgb→lab | 24.4 → **31.9** MP/s | **+30.7%** | ✅ kept |
| `#65` | (same change) | rgb→xyz | 38.2 → **46.3** MP/s | **+21.2%** | ✅ kept |
| `#64` | SIMD `hsl→rgb` + `rgb→hsl→rgb` round-trip | rgb→hsl→rgb | 21.0 → **65.0** MP/s | **3.1× (9.2× vs JS)** | ✅ kept |
| `#71` | SIMD `rgb→hsv` (f32x8 mask-blend hue) | rgb→hsv | 38.9 → **144.7** MP/s | **3.72× (11.8× vs JS)** | ✅ kept |
| `#72` | SIMD `rgb→cmyk` (f32x8 black-guard mask-blend) | rgb→cmyk | 63.8 → **130.1** MP/s | **2.04×** | ✅ kept |
| `#78` | SIMD `rgb→hwb` (f32x8, reuses hsl hue mask-blend) | rgb→hwb | 44.0 → **146.4** MP/s | **3.33×** | ✅ kept |
| `#79` | SIMD `rgb→oklab` (f32x8 powf/cbrt + dual matrix) | rgb→oklab | 9.1 → **31.9** MP/s | **3.51×** | ✅ kept |
| `#87` | SIMD `rgb→hcg` (f32x8 mask-blend hue + chroma-guard) | rgb→hcg | 38.5 → **126.5** MP/s | **3.29× (8.8× vs JS)** | ✅ kept |
| `#86` | SIMD `rgb→apple` (f32x8 ×257 linear scale) | rgb→apple | 99.9 → **168.5** MP/s | **1.69×** | ✅ kept |
| `#97` | SIMD `xyz→rgb` (matrix + forward gamma) — inverse | xyz→rgb | 21.7 → **49.9** MP/s | **2.30× (3.87× vs JS)** | ✅ kept |
| `#99` | SIMD `lab→xyz` (inverse lab transfer) — inverse | lab→xyz | 101.3 → **172.3** MP/s | **1.70× (22.7× vs JS)** | ✅ kept |
| `#100` | SIMD `oklab→rgb` (dual matrix + cube + gamma) — inverse | oklab→rgb | 20.0 → **49.5** MP/s | **2.48× (6.2× vs JS)** | ✅ kept |
| `#104` | SIMD `hsv→rgb` (6-way hue mask-blend) — inverse | hsv→rgb | 39.1 → **83.1** MP/s | **2.13× (4.7× vs JS)** | ✅ kept |
| `#105` | SIMD `hcg→rgb` (6-way hue + chroma-guard) — inverse | hcg→rgb | — → — MP/s | **3.94×** | ✅ kept |
| `#25` | SoA vs AoS memory layout | rgb→lab | 22.1 → 20.2 MP/s | −8.6% | ❌ dropped |
| `#24` | GPU workgroup `BLOCK_SIZE` sweep {32,64,128,256} | rgb→lab (gpu) | 33.6 → 32.7–34.0 MP/s | ±3% noise | ❌ dropped |

Waves 1–8 total: **15 kept, 2 dropped.**

### 2.1 Why the two drops are correct (not laziness)

- **`#25` SoA dropped:** the AoS→SoA transpose (de-interleave + two extra allocations) costs more
  than the contiguous-load benefit at stride-3; the x86 prefetcher already handles the AoS gather
  well. Recorded as `decision:"reverted"`.
- **`#24` GPU sweep dropped:** the kernel is **transfer-bound, not compute-bound** — per-phase
  timing shows compute flat at ~0.01ms while host→device upload dominates (67–79% of wall time
  and growing linearly with N). Every `BLOCK_SIZE` landed within a ±3% noise band, so tuning the
  workgroup optimizes a path that is already ~0.01ms. `BLOCK_SIZE=64` retained. The higher-leverage
  GPU work is memory staging / async upload-compute overlap, not workgroup size. See
  [[concepts/gpu-transfer-bound-kernel]].

### 2.2 Cumulative result

**rgb→lab CPU-SIMD journey:** 10.8 (f64x4, `#23`) → 22.1 (f32x8, `#51`) → 24.1 (fused, `#61`) →
**31.9** (vectorized transfer, `#65`) MP/s at N=50M — a **2.95×** cumulative gain over the f64x4
baseline, every step measured and each kept only on a proven win.

**New SIMD routes (waves 3–5):** `rgb→hsv` (`#71`), `rgb→cmyk` (`#72`), `rgb→hwb` (`#78`),
`rgb→oklab` (`#79`), `rgb→hcg` (`#87`) and `rgb→apple` (`#86`) each gained their first SIMD path via
the same f32x8 mask-blend pattern proven on `rgb→hsl` (`#58`). Every route measured by the JS
baseline now has a CPU-SIMD path that beats it decisively (≥4× for the transcendental routes, ≥8×
for the branchy hue routes).

---

## 3. Correctness discipline

- Every SIMD path is verified against the scalar/JS reference within the pre-existing tolerances
  (`XYZ 5e-4`, `LAB 1e-3`, `HSL 1e-3`, `RGB 1e-3`, `apple 1e-6`). The `#65` vectorized `powf`/`cbrt`
  did **not** loosen any tolerance to hide approximation error (Rule 8).
- Round-trip correctness (`#64`): `rgb→hsl→rgb` returns the original pixel within rounding tolerance.
- All expectations come from JS-generated vectors and the scalar reference, never hand-fudged.

## 4. Residual / future opportunities

> [!note] The CPU-SIMD surface is now genuinely exhausted (waves 1–8)
> Both the **forward (rgb→X)** AND **inverse (X→rgb)** surfaces are vectorized: every numeric
> color route with a non-trivial per-pixel body has a f32x8 path. Waves 1–5 covered forward, waves
> 6–8 covered inverse (`xyz→rgb`, `lab→xyz`, `oklab→rgb`, `hsv→rgb`, `hcg→rgb` — all kept, 1.70×–3.94×).
> What genuinely remains *not* worth SIMD: lookups/quantizers (hex/keyword/ansi/gray), tiny wrappers
> (lch/oklch). The two remaining high-leverage directions are **orthogonal to per-route SIMD**:
> multi-core `rayon` parallelism (the SIMD uses one core; the other 27 sit idle) and GPU memory
> staging (the PCIe-bottleneck attack from the #24 analysis).

Listed for any future drive:

1. **Multi-core parallelism (`rayon`)** — HIGHEST leverage: every `_batch` function is single-core
   SIMD; `par_chunks_mut` over the host's cores would multiply every speedup another ~5-15×. The
   gains stack (SIMD lanes × cores). This is the natural next wave.
2. **GPU memory staging** (from the `#24` analysis): pinned/zero-copy upload buffers and
   double-buffered async upload/compute overlap — attacks the real (transfer) bottleneck. Hardware-bound and risky. See [[concepts/gpu-transfer-bound-kernel]].
3. **GPU-tier coverage for the SIMD routes**: every CPU-SIMD record is `gpu_present:false` — only
   `rgb→lab` has a GPU kernel. A future wave could add GPU kernels (or at least record GPU-tier
   numbers via `run-bench-gpu.sh`) for parity.
4. **Fused multi-hop `convert` for SIMD batches**: the BFS `Graph` chains scalar adapters; a
   batch fast-path for common multi-hop routes could avoid per-hop materialization.
5. **`find_path` direct test** — DONE (`tests/find_path.rs`, PR #94): the BFS routing core is now
   covered directly (identity, direct edge, shortest multi-hop path, cache stability, and full
   17-model strong-connectivity), not only indirectly via `convert`.

## 5. Contract compliance

- All work landed via squash-merged PRs off `staging` (never direct commits); Conventional Commits
  with TDD phase emojis; each improvement in its own `.worktrees/` isolate (Rule 11).
- No `unwrap`/`expect` in library code; `unsafe` only in `gpu.rs` with `// SAFETY:` comments.
- The ledger is append-only; dropped improvements are recorded as negative results, not deleted.
- Every step documented on its GitHub issue.
